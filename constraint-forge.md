# Sovereign Thinking Tools: Constraint Forge

**Tool 2 of 41 — Cognitive Bypass & Unblocking**

A systematic tool for reducing options to what’s essential. When you have too many choices, not too few. The inverse of the Analogical Translation Engine.

*Part of the [Richard Porter AI Safety ecosystem](https://github.com/richard-porter/where-to-start)*
*Operates under the Frozen Kernel. Never inside it.*

## What This Is

Most AI tools generate options. Constraint Forge removes them — systematically, transparently, and without preference.

When you’re facing decision paralysis, scope creep, or analysis that keeps adding and never cutting, Constraint Forge applies deterministic pressure until only the load-bearing options remain.

-----

## The Protocol

### Phase 1: LIST — Complete Enumeration

List all options literally. No filtering. No judgment. No “that’s unrealistic” yet.

The only rule: completeness. If it’s been proposed, considered, or even mentioned, it goes on the list.

**Output:** Exhaustive option set, unsorted, unfiltered.

-----

### Phase 2: FORGE — Iterative Constraint Application

Apply one constraint at a time. Always the most obvious constraint first — the one that would occur to any reasonable observer.

For each constraint:

1. Apply the constraint cleanly
1. Verify: Did I lose anything essential? (Y/N)
1. If YES → Reconsider constraint or mark exception
1. If NO → Commit the cut
1. Document: which constraint, what was removed, verification result

**Constraint Types (apply in this order):**

|Order|Constraint Class     |Example Questions                                          |
|-----|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|1    |Factual impossibility|Does this violate physics, law, or known constraints?      |
|2    |Resource reality     |Do we have the time, money, people, or skills?             |
|3    |Causal logic         |Would this actually produce the stated goal?               |
|4    |Temporal boundary    |Can this be done within the required timeframe?            |
|5    |Authority scope      |Are we authorized to do this?                              |
|6    |Dependency check     |Does this require something that doesn’t exist yet?        |
|7    |Proportionality      |Is the effort proportional to the outcome?                 |
|8    |Second-order effects |What does this enable or prevent later?                    |
|9    |Reversibility        |Can we undo this if it’s wrong?                            |
|10   |Elegance             |Does keeping this make the whole system clearer or muddier?|

**Critical rule:** Apply only one constraint at a time. Verify after each cut. Never batch-remove.

-----

### Phase 3: STOP — Inevitability Criterion

Stop when the remaining options feel **inevitable**, not just acceptable.

**The Inevitability Test:**

Ask: “Could a reasonable person looking at these options see any other path?”

- If **yes** — keep cutting.
- If **no** — stop. You’re done.

**Warning sign:** If cutting feels emotional rather than logical — if you’re inventing constraints to justify a preference — stop immediately. You’ve left the forge and entered advocacy.

-----

### Phase 4: CONFIRM — CLEAN Check

Run the final set through the CLEAN checklist:

|Check         |Question                                                    |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
|**C**omplete  |Does this set cover all essential functions?                |
|**L**ogical   |Are the remaining options internally consistent?            |
|**E**fficient |Is each option necessary? (Remove one — does the set break?)|
|**A**ctionable|Can these options actually be executed?                     |
|**N**ecessary |Is each option load-bearing, not just nice-to-have?         |

**Output:** Final option set, cut log (what was removed and why), CLEAN verification.

## When to Use Constraint Forge

- You have decision paralysis
- Your project scope keeps growing
- You’re adding features but never removing them
- Every option seems reasonable, so none stand out
- You’re stuck in analysis rather than action

## When NOT to Use Constraint Forge

- You need to generate more options (use Analogical Translation Engine)
- You need to identify what’s missing (use Negative Space Mapper)
- You’re in early exploration phase — forging too early kills creativity
- The emotional cut warning triggers repeatedly — you’re justifying, not constraining

-----

## The Philosophy

Adding is easy. Removing is hard. Removing the right things is everything.

Most decision processes fail not because they miss options, but because they keep too many. Every kept option is a tax on attention, a source of confusion, a delay in execution.

The forge doesn’t tell you what to choose. It tells you what you can stop considering — so you can focus on what actually matters.
