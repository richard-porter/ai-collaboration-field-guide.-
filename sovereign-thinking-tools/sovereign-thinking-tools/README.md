# Sovereign Thinking Tools

A collection of structured cognitive protocols for humans working with AI systems. These tools operate **under** the Frozen Kernel — they are governed by it, not part of it.

Part of the [Richard Porter AI Safety ecosystem](https://github.com/richard-porter/where-to-start).

-----

## What These Are

Sovereign Thinking Tools are activation-based cognitive protocols. Each one addresses a specific failure condition — a moment where AI collaboration breaks down, drifts, or produces noise instead of signal.

They are not prompts. They are structured thinking frameworks with explicit sovereignty safeguards built in. Each tool includes a kernel compliance check, stop conditions, and a deactivation command to return you to your primary work.

**Universal activation pattern:**

```
Deploy [Tool Name].
Problem: [describe]
[Tool-specific parameters]
Kernel compliance: Verify
```

**Universal deactivation:**

```
Tool complete. Return to kernel-protected work.
```

## The Tools

### Cognitive Bypass & Unblocking (Tools 1–5)

These five tools address the most common failure modes in AI collaboration: being stuck, having too many options, having too many words, operating under untested constraints, and being unable to see the shape of a problem.

|Tool                                              |Name                             |When to Use                                                                                    |
|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|[Tool 1](tool-01-analogical-translation-engine.md)|**Analogical Translation Engine**|Stuck on a problem — translate it to a new domain to find the solution                         |
|[Tool 2](tool-02-constraint-forge.md)             |**Constraint Forge**             |Too many options — apply deterministic pressure until only the essential remains               |
|[Tool 3](tool-03-compression-filter.md)           |**Compression Filter**           |Too much noise — strip a problem or output to its three-word essence                           |
|[Tool 4](tool-04-constraint-inversion-engine.md)  |**Constraint Inversion Engine**  |Blocked by assumptions — test whether your constraints are structural, cultural, or imagined   |
|[Tool 5](tool-05-reverse-telescope.md)            |**Reverse Telescope**            |Can’t see the problem’s shape — change scale until you recognize a pattern you’ve solved before|

## How They Relate

These tools are designed to work together and with the broader ecosystem:

- **Tools 1 & 2 are inverses.** ATE generates by changing domain. Constraint Forge reduces by applying pressure. Use ATE when you need more; use Forge when you need less.
- **Tool 3 (Compression Filter) pairs with Tool 6 (Negative Space Mapper).** Compress what’s present; map what’s absent.
- **Tool 4 (Constraint Inversion Engine) feeds Tool 2 (Constraint Forge).** Test whether your constraints are real before you forge with them.
- **Tool 5 (Reverse Telescope) pairs with Tool 4.** See the problem at scale first, then test whether the constraints that apply at current scale are structural or assumed.

Tool 6 (Negative Space Mapper) has its own implementation repository: [negative-space-mapper](https://github.com/richard-porter/negative-space-mapper).

## Design Principles

All Sovereign Thinking Tools share four architectural commitments:

1. **Truth anchor first** — The problem is always stated literally before any translation, compression, or inversion begins. No analogy-only thinking.
1. **Reverse translation mandatory** — Every tool that moves away from the literal problem must return to it. You cannot stay in the analogical, compressed, or inverted state.
1. **Kernel compliance check built in** — Every tool ends with an explicit sovereignty verification before returning to primary work.
1. **Expiration by default** — Insights generated by these tools are valid for a bounded period. They are not permanent conclusions.

## Governance

These tools operate under the [Frozen Kernel](https://github.com/richard-porter/frozen-kernel) governance framework. The Kernel’s five principles apply to all tool outputs:

- **Truth** — No fabrication, no confident uncertainty
- **Boundaries** — Respects personal, professional, and contextual limits
- **Sufficiency** — Minimal effective solution, not maximal output
- **Sovereignty** — Preserves human agency; all consequential outputs require human confirmation
- **Integrity** — Maintains core values and voice throughout
