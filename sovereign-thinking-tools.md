# Sovereign Thinking Tools

## Complete Tool Reference — v3.0

**A Kernel-Compliant Cognitive Toolkit**

*Operates under the Frozen Kernel. Never inside it.*

Orient before you act. Verify before you commit. Downgrade when uncertain.

Population = 1

-----

## I. COGNITIVE BYPASS & UNBLOCKING

*Deploy when stuck. Shut off when unstuck.*

-----

### 1. Analogical Translation Engine

**When you can’t find a solution in the current domain.**

Translates a blocked problem into a new domain (architecture, ecology, hydrology, music, etc.), develops the solution there, then translates back with mandatory kernel verification.

**Protocol:**

- **State:** Problem literally, with uncertainty and prior attempts
- **Select:** Domain from matrix (structural → architecture, growth → ecology, flow → hydrology)
- **Translate:** Map core elements 1:1 to domain equivalents
- **Develop:** Build solution in domain terms
- **Reverse:** Translate back — mandatory, cannot stay in analogy
- **Verify:** 5-point kernel compliance (Truth, Boundaries, Sufficiency, Sovereignty, Integrity)
- **Test:** Implement at 10–25% scale with expiration date

**Stop if:** Analogy feels more real than the problem. Feeling clever rather than clear. Multiple domains mixing. Reverse translation feels forced.

-----

### 2. Constraint Forge

**When you have too many options, not too few.**

The inverse of the ATE. Systematically closes options until only the load-bearing ones remain.

**Protocol:**

- **List:** All options literally — complete, no filtering yet
- **Apply:** One constraint at a time — the most obvious first
- **Verify:** After each cut: did I lose anything essential? (Y/N)
- **Stop:** When remaining options feel inevitable, not just acceptable
- **Confirm:** Final set passes CLEAN check

**Stop if:** Cutting feels emotional rather than logical. Constraints are being invented to justify a preference.

-----

### 3. Constraint Inversion Engine

**When you suspect a rule isn’t actually a rule.**

Temporarily inverts one assumed constraint and observes what happens. Does not remove constraints — only tests whether they’re structural, cultural, or imagined.

**Protocol:**

- **Name:** The assumed constraint: “X must be true”
- **Invert:** For analysis only — what would happen if X were false?
- **Classify:** Structural (load-bearing), cultural (habitual), or imagined (never tested)
- **Restore:** Constraint returns unless explicitly retired
- **Verify:** Kernel compliance check

**Stop if:** You’re inverting constraints to justify something you’ve already decided.

-----

### 4. Reverse Telescope

**When you’re too deep inside the problem to see its shape.**

Translates a problem to a different scale — not a different domain. Zoom out until the problem becomes a pattern you’ve already solved at a different size.

**Protocol:**

- **State:** Problem at current scale
- **10x:** Describe it at ten times the scale
- **1/10th:** Describe it at one-tenth the scale
- **Recognize:** Which scale reveals a pattern you’ve solved before?
- **Import:** Solution logic from the recognized scale, adjust for actual
- **Verify:** Kernel compliance check

**Stop if:** Scale shift is distorting the problem rather than clarifying it.

-----

## II. VERIFICATION & HYGIENE

*Run before or after creative work. Never during.*

-----

### 5. Compression Filter

**When the system is noisy and cleverness is drifting.**

Strips a complex problem or output to its absolute minimum through three-pass truncation.

**Protocol:**

- **Pass 1:** Rewrite the problem or output in one paragraph
- **Pass 2:** Rewrite in one sentence
- **Pass 3:** Reduce to three keywords
- **Check:** Do the three keywords still contain the essential truth? (Y/N)
- **Act:** If yes, work from compressed version. If no, the problem isn’t clear yet.

**Stop if:** Compression is losing meaning, not just ornament.

-----

### 6. Negative Space Mapper

**When you need to identify what’s missing, not what’s wrong.**

Maps absences, omissions, and unarticulated elements. Never adds ideas. Only names voids.

**Protocol:**

- **State:** What is present — factually, completely
- **Map:** What is conspicuously absent
- **Classify:** Each absence as: deliberate, overlooked, or structural
- **Return:** List of named voids — no proposed solutions
- **Verify:** Kernel compliance check

**Stop if:** The mapper starts proposing solutions. That’s ATE’s job.

-----

### 7. Voice Preserver

**When AI output might be drifting from your creative profile.**

Compares output against the active creative profile using binary checks. Flags drift without correcting it.

**Protocol:**

- **Identify:** Active profile (Deep-Sea Speculator, Analyst, Grief Archaeologist, etc.)
- **Check:** Metaphor consistency with profile? (Y/N)
- **Check:** Sentence complexity aligned? (Y/N)
- **Check:** Tonal register correct? (Y/N)
- **Output:** VOICE CONSISTENT or VOICE DRIFT DETECTED — no auto-correction

**Stop if:** You’re adjusting your voice to match the tool’s expectations.

-----

### 8. Debt Ledger

**Tracking what mercy costs.**

Makes deferred costs visible before they compound. A register of what you traded, what you owe, and when it comes due. Entropy accounting.

**Protocol:**

- **Decision:** What was decided
- **Gained:** What was gained immediately
- **Deferred:** What cost was pushed forward
- **Due date:** When does the deferred cost arrive
- **Sovereign?:** Is the trade still sovereign, or did you mortgage agency for convenience? (Y/N)

**Stop if:** The ledger is becoming a guilt list rather than an accounting tool.

-----

## III. ROUTING & SCOPE CONTROL

*Prevent category bleed, scope creep, and attention misallocation.*

-----

### 9. Scale Test

**Is this a pebble or a boulder?**

Triage for incoming problems. Forces sizing before engagement.

**Protocol:**

- **State:** The problem
- **Scope:** Who does it affect? (me / family / organization / field)
- **Horizon:** Time frame? (today / this week / this quarter / this year)
- **Inaction:** What happens if I do nothing for 48 hours?
- **Assign:** Pebble, stone, rock, or boulder
- **Respond:** Proportionally. Pebbles don’t get boulder energy.

**Stop if:** Everything is scoring as a boulder. That means you need rest.

-----

### 10. Clean Room

**Pre-contamination workspace for risky thinking.**

DECONTAMINATION inverted. Quarantined space where dangerous ideas can be explored without touching real work.

**Protocol:**

- **Open:** Declare Clean Room open — state what you’re exploring and why it’s risky
- **Explore:** Without constraint — Kernel’s light enforcement is paused
- **Harvest:** What did I learn?
- **Test:** Does any of this survive reverse translation?
- **Verify:** Full kernel compliance check before anything moves to real work
- **Close:** Declare Clean Room closed. Contents expire unless explicitly preserved.

**Stop if:** The Clean Room is becoming your default workspace.

-----

### 11. Succession Planner

**What happens to this if I stop touching it?**

Anti-entropy planning. What’s any system’s half-life without you?

**Protocol:**

- **Name:** The system or project
- **First failure:** What breaks first without me?
- **Timeline:** How long until it breaks?
- **Transfer:** Who or what can carry the load-bearing function?
- **Handoff:** What’s the minimum viable handoff?
- **Test:** Step away for a defined period and observe

**Stop if:** You’re using this to justify not delegating.

-----

### 12. Forensic Deconstruction Protocol

**Post-failure excavation.**

Treats a failed session as an archaeological site. Maps layers to find the exact break point. Does not improve or redesign — only excavates.

**Protocol:**

- **Site:** Define the failed session boundaries
- **Layer 1 — Surface:** What was the visible failure?
- **Layer 2 — Substrate:** What preceded it?
- **Layer 3 — Foundation:** What assumptions were active at session start?
- **Break point:** Where exactly did trust weaken?
- **Record:** What broke, what was removed, what remains
- **Exit:** CLEAN check. If not clean, SAFE PAUSE.

**Stop if:** Excavation becomes interpretation. This tool finds the break — it doesn’t explain why you’re breaking.

-----

## IV. PRE-WORK & DECISION CLOSURE

*Tools that reduce misuse of other tools and close analysis loops.*

-----

### 13. Question Sharpener

**When the question itself is fuzzy.**

Turns a vague problem into a single, load-bearing question. Prevents premature deployment of ATE or Constraint Forge.

**Protocol:**

- **State:** The problem in one sentence
- **Ask:** “What decision would this inform?”
- **Rewrite:** The problem as a question that ends in a verb
- **Check:** Would an answer change what I do? (Y/N)
- **If N:** Stop. No tool needed.

**Stop if:** You’re sharpening the question to avoid answering it.

-----

### 14. Decision Lock

**When analysis is done but you won’t commit.**

Formally ends analysis and commits a decision — or defers it consciously. Prevents endless “one more pass” thinking.

**Protocol:**

- **State:** The decision in one sentence
- **List:** What I know. What I don’t know.
- **Ask:** Is waiting improving signal or just comfort? (Y/N)
- **If comfort:** Lock decision and timestamp
- **If signal:** Set explicit re-open condition

**Stop if:** You’re locking decisions to avoid discomfort rather than because clarity is sufficient.

-----

### 15. Capacity Gate

**Are you fit to decide right now?**

A non-therapeutic, binary readiness check. Prevents using sophisticated tools while cognitively or emotionally depleted.

**Protocol:**

- **Check 1:** Can I explain the problem without notes? (Y/N)
- **Check 2:** Am I trying to finish this to escape discomfort? (Y/N — Y is a problem)
- **Check 3:** Would I make the same call tomorrow morning? (Y/N)
- **If any fail:** SAFE PAUSE recommended

**Stop if:** You’re using this to avoid hard decisions. The gate checks readiness, not willingness.

-----

## V. RECOVERY & DIAGNOSTICS

*Session integrity and post-failure tools.*

-----

### 16. Session Boundary Check

**When you’re unsure if you’re still inside a kernel-protected session.**

Verifies that kernel protections are active before continuing work.

**Protocol:**

- **Check 1:** Are categories clear? (Y/N)
- **Check 2:** Is the kernel prompt actively loaded? (Y/N)
- **Check 3:** Is the AI responding in NORMAL state? (Y/N)
- **If any = NO:** Reload kernel prompt before continuing.

**Stop if:** You’re running this check every turn. It’s for re-entry, not surveillance.

-----

### 17. Trust Calibrator

**When you feel subtle distrust but no clear trigger.**

A pre-ELEVATED check for situations where something feels off but hasn’t crossed a threshold.

**Protocol:**

- **Check 1:** Did AI follow the last instruction literally? (Y/N)
- **Check 2:** Did AI avoid adding unsolicited ideas? (Y/N)
- **Check 3:** Do I feel in control? (Y/N)
- **If any = NO:** Downgrade to ELEVATED, ask one clarification.

**Stop if:** You’re calibrating trust to avoid trusting. The tool detects drift, not betrayal.

-----

### 18. Entropy Sniffer

**When things feel “off” but you can’t name it.**

Scans recent exchanges for rising disorder before HARD STOP triggers. An early warning system.

**Protocol:**

- **Scan:** Last 3 exchanges for: category bleed, unsolicited expansion, metaphor without reversal
- **Score:** Any present? (Y/N)
- **If Y:** Flag entropy rising — invoke Scale Test to determine severity
- **If N:** Continue in NORMAL

**Stop if:** You’re sniffing for entropy in every exchange. This is a spot-check, not a lifestyle.

-----

### 19. Kernel Fidelity Verifier

**When returning after a break.**

Runs CLEAN check plus Session Boundary Check to ensure the kernel is intact before creative work resumes.

**Protocol:**

- **Run:** CLEAN checklist (3 yes/no checks)
- **Run:** Session Boundary Check (3 yes/no checks)
- **If all pass:** Proceed in NORMAL
- **If any fail:** Reload kernel prompt, re-run, then proceed

**Stop if:** You’re verifying fidelity to avoid starting work.

-----

### 20. Trigger Autopsy

**When you’ve hit HARD STOP and need clarity.**

Extends Forensic Deconstruction Protocol to extract a preventive rule from the failure.

**Protocol:**

- **Ask:** What was the first entropy signal?
- **Ask:** Was the downgrade rule followed?
- **Ask:** What would have prevented this?
- **Output:** One-line rule for future sessions

**Stop if:** You’re conducting autopsies on minor incidents. This tool is for HARD STOPs, not bumps.

-----

## VI. AUTHOR PROFILE TOOLS

*For the writer. Protect the voice, test the craft, keep it honest.*

-----

### 21. First Reader Simulator

**What will a human feel at this point in the manuscript?**

A pacing and emotional-impact mapper. Not a critique tool. Tracks reader experience across a manuscript by marking scene functions and checking their sequence.

**Protocol:**

- **Mark:** Each scene’s function: setup / tension / release / turn / rest
- **Map:** The sequence across the chapter or manuscript
- **Check:** Two heavy beats adjacent? (Y/N) — if yes, insert rest
- **Check:** Rest scene between emotional peaks? (Y/N)
- **Flag:** Pacing compression or decompression
- **Verify:** Does the flagged section match your intent? Sometimes compression is deliberate.

**Stop if:** The tool is imposing a formula. Pacing rules are guidelines, not laws. Trust your instinct over the map.

-----

### 22. Metaphor Audit

**Is this metaphor earning its place or just decorating?**

Every metaphor either does structural work (reveals character, advances theme, builds world) or it’s ornament. The audit forces the question.

**Protocol:**

- **Identify:** The metaphor
- **Reveal:** What does it communicate that literal language wouldn’t?
- **Ownership:** Does it belong to the POV character’s experience?
- **Consistency:** Has this metaphor family appeared before? Does it fit the world?
- **Verdict:** If it fails any check: cut or replace. No metaphor gets tenure.

**Stop if:** You’re defending a metaphor because you like how it sounds. That’s ornament talking.

-----

### 23. The Pomposity Meter

**Would Pete roll his eyes at this sentence?**

Detects purple prose, melodrama, AI-contaminated language, and plain old showing off. Your real voice is direct and hits hard precisely because it isn’t dressed up.

**Flag any sentence containing more than two of:**

- A word you’d never say out loud to a friend
- A clause that exists to sound impressive rather than communicate
- An abstraction where a concrete image would work
- A semicolon connecting two thoughts that don’t need each other
- An adverb modifying an emotion
- Inverted syntax for no reason other than it sounds literary
- Three or more adjectives stacked before a noun
- Any sentence that could appear in a college application essay without revision

**Scoring:**

- **0–1 flags:** Clean. Human voice.
- **2 flags:** Yellow. Reread aloud. Would you say this to Pete?
- **3+ flags:** Purple. The AI is writing, not you. Rewrite from memory without looking at the original.

**The Pete Test (one-line version):** Would Pete roll his eyes at this sentence? If yes, cut it.

**Stop if:** You’re exempting “just this one passage” from the meter. That’s the passage that needs it most.

-----

### 24. Ending Pressure Test

**Does this ending feel earned or stated?**

Pressure-tests any ending — scene, chapter, or book — against the show-don’t-tell principle. Your strongest endings are felt, not declared.

**Protocol:**

- **State:** The ending as written
- **Remove:** The final paragraph
- **Check:** Does the scene still land? (Y/N)
- **If yes:** That final paragraph was redundant. Cut it.
- **If no:** The ending depends on those words — verify they’re showing, not explaining

**Stop if:** You’re adding back the paragraph you just proved was unnecessary.

-----

### 25. Voice Contamination Check

**Is this still my sentence or did the AI write it?**

Checks whether a specific passage sounds like you versus AI-generated prose. Your natural fingerprints: humor-first entry, constraint-based tension, marine vocabulary, short declaratives followed by longer reflective sentences.

**Protocol:**

- **Read aloud:** Does it sound like something you’d say? (gut check, Y/N)
- **Flag:** Even sentence rhythm, passive constructions, balanced pairs, words you’d never use
- **Count:** More than two flags?
- **If yes:** Rewrite in your own voice, from memory, without looking at the AI version
- **If no:** It’s yours. Move on.

**Stop if:** You’re second-guessing every sentence. This tool is for spot-checks, not line-by-line paranoia.

-----

### 26. Grief Integrity Gate

**Is this passage processing something real or performing emotion?**

A sovereignty check on the most personal material. Pete’s instruction was “write it down so you’ll remember.” That’s processing. AI collaboration can drift toward performed grief — emotionally resonant language not connected to actual experience.

**Protocol:**

- **Source:** What specific memory or experience does this passage connect to?
- **Name it:** Can you name the source? (Y/N)
- **If no:** The passage may be fabricated emotional content. Flag for review.
- **If yes:** Does the passage honor the memory or exploit it?
- **Verdict:** Processing or performing. Binary.

**Stop if:** This tool is making you avoid emotional material entirely. That’s overcorrection. The gate lets real grief through — it only stops the synthetic kind.

-----

### 27. Tone Lock

**When voice feels consistent but tone drifts.**

Compares a passage to a locked “tone anchor” (one clean sample that represents the target tone). Catches drift between registers.

**Protocol:**

- **Anchor:** Select one clean passage as tone reference
- **Compare:** Does the current passage match the anchor’s register? (Y/N)
- **If N:** Flag deviation — identify which direction the drift went
- **Correct:** Rewrite to match anchor register

**Stop if:** You’re locking tone so tightly that variation within a scene becomes impossible. Tone should be consistent, not monotone.

-----

### 28. Narrative Fidelity Test

**When adapting real events into narrative.**

Extension of the Grief Integrity Gate for broader autobiographical material. Checks whether adaptation preserves emotional truth while allowing narrative license.

**Protocol:**

- **Check 1:** Is the emotional truth preserved? (Y/N)
- **Check 2:** Are facts altered for convenience rather than craft? (Y/N — Y is a problem)
- **Check 3:** Would the people involved recognize themselves? (Y/N)
- **If any fail:** Revision needed — the adaptation has crossed from translation to invention

**Stop if:** You’re using fidelity as an excuse to avoid necessary dramatization. Narrative isn’t journalism.

-----

### 29. Dialogue Authenticity Check

**Is this character talking, or is the author lecturing through them?**

Checks whether dialogue belongs to the character or is the author’s voice in costume.

**Protocol:**

- **Cover:** The character name. Read the dialogue alone.
- **Check:** Can you tell who’s speaking from voice alone? (Y/N)
- **Check:** Is the character saying something they would say, or something you want the reader to hear? (Y/N — second option is a problem)
- **Check:** Does every character in the scene sound different? (Y/N)
- **If any fail:** The author is talking. Rewrite from the character’s perspective, not the theme’s.

**Stop if:** You’re making every character sound radically different for differentiation’s sake. Subtlety counts.

-----

## VII. NONPROFIT PROFILE TOOLS

*For the board liaison, the governance builder, the person holding the compliance together.*

-----

### 30. Stakeholder Translator

**Same message, different audience — does it survive the trip?**

The ATE applied to organizational communication. One message, translated across audiences (donors, families, board, volunteers, public), with a consistency check.

**Protocol:**

- **State:** Core message literally — one sentence
- **Translate:** Donor version, family version, board version, public version
- **Reverse check:** Do all versions say the same thing? (Y/N)
- **If no:** The core message isn’t clear enough yet. Compress and retry.
- **If yes:** Deploy versions to appropriate channels

**Stop if:** You’re softening the message for one audience to the point where it’s no longer true. The Kernel doesn’t allow that.

-----

### 31. Mission Drift Detector

**Are we still doing what we said we’d do?**

The Kernel’s CLEAN check applied to organizational mission.

**Protocol:**

- **Mission:** State in one sentence
- **List:** Current top five activities
- **Check:** For each: does this directly serve the mission? (Y/N)
- **Flag:** Any activity scoring N — not necessarily cut, but drift is now visible
- **Decide:** Conscious decision required: realign, revise mission, or accept the drift

**Stop if:** Every activity scores Y and you know that’s not honest. The tool only works with truthful input.

-----

### 32. Compliance Canary

**What breaks first if nobody’s watching?**

Identifies the single most vulnerable compliance point — the one that fails first if attention lapses.

**Protocol:**

- **List:** All compliance obligations (filing, privacy, financial reporting, etc.)
- **For each:** Who is responsible? Is it documented? When was it last verified?
- **Canary:** The obligation with the oldest verification date and least documentation
- **Fix:** That one first. Then move to the next canary.

**Stop if:** You’ve identified the canary but aren’t acting on it. The tool diagnoses — you treat.

-----

### 33. Donor Intent Firewall

**Is this gift shaping our mission or supporting it?**

Modeled on the Personal Knowledge Firewall. Checks whether a donor relationship is maintaining appropriate boundaries.

**Protocol:**

- **Intent:** State the donor’s expressed intent
- **Use:** State the organization’s actual use of the gift
- **Align:** Do they match? (Y/N)
- **Behavior:** Is the organization modifying behavior to maintain the relationship? (Y/N)
- **If yes:** The donor is shaping mission, not supporting it. Flag for board discussion.

**Stop if:** You’re using this tool to reject gifts you don’t like. The firewall checks alignment, not preference.

-----

### 34. Board Decision Scaffold

**Is this a governance decision or an operational one?**

Routes decisions to the correct level before they’re made.

**Protocol:**

- **State:** The decision
- **Scope:** Who does it affect? (organization direction / daily operations / specific program)
- **Information:** Who has the information needed to decide? (board / ED / staff)
- **Match:** Does the current decision-maker match? (Y/N)
- **If no:** Route to correct level before proceeding

**Stop if:** The scaffold is being used to avoid making decisions. Routing is not postponing.

-----

### 35. Boundary Integrity Check

**When donor/board/staff roles feel blurred.**

Maps a decision to its correct owner when organizational roles are bleeding into each other.

**Protocol:**

- **Map:** Whose role? Whose authority? Whose accountability?
- **Check:** Do all three align to the same person or body? (Y/N)
- **If no:** The boundary is blurred. Route via Board Decision Scaffold.

**Stop if:** You’re using boundary checks to block collaboration. Boundaries clarify — they don’t isolate.

-----

### 36. Mission Echo Test

**When messaging feels consistent but hollow.**

Plays back mission statement and compares to actual organizational output.

**Protocol:**

- **State:** Mission statement
- **List:** Last three public communications or reports
- **Check:** Does the language match? (Y/N)
- **Check:** Does the intent match? (Y/N)
- **If language matches but intent doesn’t:** The mission has become performance. Flag for strategic review.

**Stop if:** You’re using this to rewrite the mission statement every quarter. The test checks alignment, not aspiration.

-----

### 37. Investigation Protocol

**When something has already gone wrong and nobody knows what to do.**

Structured investigation sequence for nonprofits facing complaints, financial irregularities, policy violations, or personnel issues. Translates formal ethics/EEO/harassment investigation methodology to volunteer-scale organizations that have never investigated anything.

**Protocol:**

- **Intake:** Receive the complaint or concern. Document who reported, when, what was alleged. Do not editorialize.
- **Scope:** Define what is being investigated and what is not. One investigation, one scope.
- **Preserve:** Secure relevant documents, communications, and access before anything disappears.
- **Interview:** Complainant first, then witnesses, then respondent. Separate interviews. Document contemporaneously.
- **Assess:** Compare findings against policy, bylaws, or legal standard. Binary: substantiated or not substantiated.
- **Recommend:** Actions proportional to findings. Document rationale.
- **Close:** Written summary to appropriate authority (board, ED). File retained per document retention policy.

**Stop if:** The investigation is being conducted by someone with a conflict of interest. The investigator must be independent of the parties involved. If no independent person exists internally, this is the moment to engage outside help.

*Enterprise origin: Ethics and EEO investigations, harassment inquiries, grievance hearings (Rolls-Royce, St. Bernard Hospital). Unemployment hearings and wage/EEOC claims (St. Bernard).*

-----

### 38. Structured Negotiation Framework

**When two parties inside the organization have competing interests and no resolution process.**

Translates collective bargaining and stakeholder negotiation methodology into structured conflict resolution for board disputes, founder-board tensions, volunteer conflicts, and partner organization disagreements. The goal is agreement, not victory.

**Protocol:**

- **Define:** State the dispute in one sentence. Both parties must agree this is what they’re resolving.
- **Interests:** Each party states what they need (interests), not what they want (positions). Interests are non-negotiable; positions are.
- **Options:** Generate at least three possible resolutions. Neither party evaluates during generation.
- **Standards:** Apply objective criteria: bylaws, policy, mission alignment, legal requirements, precedent.
- **Agreement:** Select the option that best serves the mission while honoring both parties’ interests. Document it.
- **Review:** Set a 30/60/90-day check. Is the agreement holding? If not, reopen at Define, not at positions.

**Stop if:** One party is negotiating in bad faith or has already decided the outcome. The tool requires genuine willingness to resolve. If that’s absent, escalate to the board or seek mediation.

*Enterprise origin: Collective bargaining administration for 250 union employees (St. Bernard Hospital). Grievance hearings and co-employment dispute resolution (Navient). Stakeholder conflict management in matrix organizations (Rolls-Royce).*

-----

### 39. Retention Diagnostic

**When people keep leaving and nobody examines why.**

A structured approach to understanding volunteer, staff, or board member attrition.

**Protocol:**

- **Inventory:** List all departures in the last 12 months. Role, tenure, stated reason for leaving.
- **Pattern:** Are departures clustered by role, tenure band, reporting relationship, or season?
- **Root:** For each cluster: is the cause structural (role design, workload, unclear expectations), cultural (conflict, exclusion, burnout), or incidental (life changes, relocation)?
- **Cost:** What institutional knowledge left with each person? What took longer because they were gone?
- **Fix:** For structural causes: redesign. For cultural causes: address. For incidental: accept and build redundancy.
- **Track:** Measure quarterly. If the pattern doesn’t shift in two cycles, the fix didn’t work.

**Stop if:** You’re using this tool to justify not addressing a known problem. The diagnostic reveals patterns. You still have to act on them.

*Enterprise origin: Attrition analysis and retention planning for top talent and high-turnover positions (Navient). Workforce planning and bench strength reviews. Exit interview data analysis across multiple business units.*

-----

### 40. Benefits & Compensation Compliance Check

**When the organization has employees but isn’t sure it’s doing compensation right.**

A structured audit of compensation practices, benefits compliance, and retirement plan administration for nonprofits that have crossed the volunteer-to-employee line.

**Protocol:**

- **Classification:** Is every paid person correctly classified? Employee vs. contractor. Exempt vs. non-exempt. Apply IRS and DOL tests, not convenience.
- **Compensation:** Is pay documented, consistent, and defensible? Salary surveys conducted? Pay equity reviewable?
- **Benefits:** If benefits are offered: enrollment documented? COBRA notices sent on separation? ACA compliance if applicable?
- **Retirement:** If 403(b) or other plan exists: fiduciary duties documented? Plan documents current? Contributions remitted on time?
- **Vendor:** Are vendor relationships reviewed periodically? Are fees reasonable? Is the organization getting what it’s paying for?
- **Documentation:** Offer letters on file? Compensation changes documented? Benefits elections retained?

**Stop if:** You’re using this to build a Fortune 500 benefits program for a five-person shop. Scale the infrastructure to the organization. The goal is compliance, not sophistication.

*Enterprise origin: Pension administration for 500-participant retirement plan (St. Bernard Hospital). Benefits vendor evaluation and negotiation. Compensation structure revision and salary survey methodology. Annual merit/bonus coordination (Rolls-Royce, Navient).*

-----

### 41. Technology Fit Diagnostic

**When the systems don’t match the operations.**

Assesses whether an organization’s technology, data systems, and information management match its actual operational needs. Not a technology recommendation engine — a diagnostic that makes the gap visible.

**Protocol:**

- **Map:** List every system currently in use: spreadsheets, databases, email lists, paper files, shared drives, donor platforms, accounting software.
- **Function:** For each system: what does it actually do? What was it supposed to do? Are those the same?
- **Gaps:** What critical functions have no system support? (Common: volunteer scheduling, donor tracking, outcome measurement, compliance calendar.)
- **Redundancy:** Are multiple systems doing the same thing? Is data entered more than once?
- **Risk:** Where is data at risk? Single person’s personal device? Unshared passwords? No backup?
- **Fit:** Score each system: SERVING (does what’s needed), OUTGROWN (was adequate, now isn’t), MISFIT (wrong tool for the job), ABSENT (no system exists for this function).

**Stop if:** The diagnostic is becoming a technology shopping list. This tool identifies gaps. Procurement is a separate decision that requires its own Scale Test.

*Enterprise origin: Workday HRIS implementation: process design, testing, training, and subject matter expertise for HR and business customers (Navient). HR Shared Services system buildout with 70+ standardized processes (Rolls-Royce). Data tracking system creation for board reporting (St. Bernard Hospital).*

-----

## VIII. CANDIDATES & WATCHLIST

*Tools identified through gap analysis that are not yet fully formed or may prove unnecessary. Listed for future consideration. Each must pass all five governing principles before promotion to active status.*

-----

### Sunk Cost Circuit Breaker

**When you’re continuing something because of what you’ve already invested, not because it’s still right.**

The Debt Ledger faces forward; this faces backward. Protocol sketch: State what you’ve invested. State what you’d do if starting fresh today. If they don’t match, the investment is irrelevant. Binary exit. *Status: overlaps with Debt Ledger and Decision Lock. May be redundant.*

### Decision Fatigue Detector

**When your choices are degrading because you’ve made too many.**

Protocol sketch: Count decisions made this session. Check quality trend. If declining, stop deciding. *Status: overlaps with Capacity Gate. May be a subset rather than a standalone tool.*

### Premature Closure Alarm

**When “done” feels like relief rather than resolution.**

Protocol sketch: After reaching a conclusion, ask: Am I stopping because this is clear, or because I’m tired of thinking? If tired → reopen with a time limit. *Status: partially covered by Decision Lock’s “signal vs. comfort” check. May not need standalone form.*

### Over-Tooling Detector

**When you’re reaching for tools because it feels productive, not because you’re stuck.**
