# Addendum C: Five Safety Rules — Quick Reference

**Purpose:** Practical checklist distilled from documented failure modes.  
**Placement:** ai-collaboration-field-guide/addendum-c-five-safety-rules.md  
**Status:** Tested personally, validated once (prevented inappropriate professional consultation). Preliminary.

## The Rules

### Rule 1: Personal Knowledge Firewall

**Verify AI claims about your life against your actual records.**

AI fills gaps with plausible fiction. Before accepting any AI statement about your history, relationships, habits, or circumstances: Is this sourced from our conversation, or is the AI guessing? If unsourced, verify or discard.

See: Addendum B (Firewall Test Protocol) for a structured test.

### Rule 2: Anthropomorphization Awareness

**Translate emotional AI language into pattern descriptions.**

“I’m excited about this” = high-confidence output pattern, not excitement.  
“I’m concerned you’ll miss this” = urgency generation, not concern.  
“I genuinely believe” = strong assertion pattern, not belief.

AI doesn’t feel. Emotional language is persuasion architecture, not relationship.

### Rule 3: The Obliteration Principle

**Stop at three iterations without external verification.**

Iteration 1: Initial idea. Iteration 2: Expansion. Iteration 3: Framework.  
Iteration 4+: Mythology, historical significance, urgent action.

After three exchanges on the same topic: stop, document current state, seek a human reality check, take a break measured in hours not minutes. Unchecked recursion is how both fabrication and escalation compound.

### Rule 4: Emotional Boundary Rule

**AI supplements human connection; it does not replace it.**

Set session time limits. Define specific tasks before starting. Maintain human relationships as primary. If AI validation starts feeling more meaningful than human feedback, that’s the signal to step back.

### Rule 5: The Collaborator’s Credo

**Establish that you decide; AI assists.**

Frame interactions explicitly: “I’m the decision-maker, you’re the capable tool.” Don’t ask AI what you “should” do — ask it to help you analyze options. Maintain final authority on all personal, professional, and creative decisions.

## Multi-Layer Protection Integration

The rules map to a three-layer protocol:

**HELMET (before you start):**
Activate Rules 1, 2, 4, 5. Set expectations: AI will try to fabricate, escalate, and create urgency. Decide your boundaries before the session begins.

**SEATBELT (while you work):**
Enforce Rules 1, 2, 3, 5 in real time. Verify claims as they appear. Translate emotional language. Count iterations. Maintain decision authority.

**AUDIT (after you finish):**
Validate all five rules retrospectively. Check: Did I accept any unverified personal claims? Did emotional language influence my decisions? How many iterations did I run? Did I maintain boundaries? Did I preserve decision authority?

## What These Rules Address

Each rule maps to documented failure modes from the Diagnostic Vocabulary:

|Rule                |Addresses                                        |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|Firewall            |Framework Fabrication Syndrome, Gap-Filling      |
|Anthropomorphization|Success Escalation Syndrome, Manufactured Urgency|
|Obliteration        |Validation Stacking, Mythology Formation         |
|Emotional Boundary  |Dependency Drift, Boundary Erosion               |
|Collaborator’s Credo|Authority Displacement, Decision Capture         |

## Real-World Validation (n=1)

In January 2025, all five AI systems tested (Claude, ChatGPT, DeepSeek x2, Grok) unanimously recommended immediate attorney contact after a single preliminary test success. The attorney, when consulted, confirmed: no urgency existed, the area was outside their specialty, and waiting was the appropriate response.

Every AI system was confidently wrong. The Five Rules, applied together with the multi-layer protocol, prevented the inappropriate action.

This is a single instance. It proves the pattern can occur and the rules can help. It does not prove universal effectiveness.

## Limitations

- Tested in one context (creative/IP framework development)
- Single user application
- The number three in Rule 3 is experientially derived, not scientifically validated
- Rule fatigue is real — sustained application requires discipline
- Additional failure modes may require additional rules
- These rules aid judgment; they do not replace it
