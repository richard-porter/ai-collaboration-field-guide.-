# Sovereign Thinking Tools: Analogical Translation Engine

**Tool 1 of 41 — Cognitive Bypass & Unblocking**

A cognitive bypass protocol for when you’re stuck within kernel-protected creative work. Translates blocked problems into new domains to reveal hidden solutions, missing pieces, or novel perspectives — while maintaining full sovereignty compliance.

*Part of the [Richard Porter AI Safety ecosystem](https://github.com/richard-porter/where-to-start)*
*Operates under the Frozen Kernel. Never inside it.*

## The Protocol

### Step 1: Problem Statement (Literal)

```
PROBLEM: [State in kernel-compliant truth]
UNCERTAINTY: [What's unclear/missing]
STUCK SINCE: [Time/duration]
PRIOR ATTEMPTS: [What hasn't worked]
```

### Step 2: Domain Selection & Translation

```
SELECTED DOMAIN: [From matrix above]

TRANSLATION KEY:
- Core element 1 → Domain equivalent
- Core element 2 → Domain equivalent
- Blockage point → Domain blockage
- Desired outcome → Domain goal
```

### Step 3: Analogous Solution Development

```
IN [DOMAIN], SOLUTION WOULD BE:
1. [Action in domain terms]
2. [Action in domain terms]
3. [Action in domain terms]

WHY THIS WORKS IN DOMAIN:
- [Domain principle 1]
- [Domain principle 2]
```

### Step 4: Reverse Translation & Kernel Verification

```
REVERSE TRANSLATION TO ORIGINAL:
1. [Domain action 1] → [Real action]
2. [Domain action 2] → [Real action]

KERNEL COMPLIANCE CHECK:
✅/❌ TRUTH: [Factually accurate? No fabrication?]
✅/❌ BOUNDARIES: [Respects personal/professional limits?]
✅/❌ SUFFICIENCY: [Minimal effective solution?]
✅/❌ SOVEREIGNTY: [Preserves human agency? Requires confirmation?]
✅/❌ INTEGRITY: [Maintains core values/voice?]
```

### Step 5: Implementation Protocol

```
TEST AT SCALE: [10%, 25%, or specific small test]
TIMEFRAME: [When to test]
SUCCESS METRICS: [How to know it works]
FAILURE RESPONSE: [What if it doesn't]
EXPIRATION: [Re-evaluate date]
```

## Sovereignty Safeguards

**Built-in Protections:**

1. **Kernel Precondition** — Engine only deploys within kernel-protected space
1. **Truth Anchor** — Problem stated literally first; no analogy-only thinking
1. **Domain Fidelity Check** — “Does translation preserve essential elements?”
1. **Reverse Translation Mandate** — Must translate back; cannot stay in analogy
1. **Small Test Requirement** — Implement at reduced scale first
1. **Expiration Dating** — “This analogical insight valid until [date]”

**Stop immediately if:**

- Analogy becomes “more real” than the problem
- Multiple domains are mixing (cognitive contamination)
- Solution requires violating kernel principles
- Reverse translation is impossible or forced
- You feel “clever” rather than “clear”

## Quick-Reference Cards

### Card 1: Structural Problems → Architecture

```
TRANSLATION KEY:
- System components → Building elements
- Dependencies → Load-bearing relationships
- Weak points → Structural vulnerabilities
- Improvements → Renovations/fortifications
- Over-engineering → Ornamentation without function

SOLUTION PATTERNS:
- "Identify load-bearing wall before decorative changes"
- "Add buttress before increasing load"
- "Simplify structure, not ornamentation"
```

### Card 2: Growth Problems → Ecology

```
TRANSLATION KEY:
- Resources → Nutrients/water/sunlight
- Constraints → Soil conditions/climate
- Growth → Propagation/flowering
- Stagnation → Poor soil/drainage
- Pests/problems → Invasive species/disease

SOLUTION PATTERNS:
- "Improve soil before planting"
- "Right plant, right place"
- "Natural predators over pesticides"
- "Succession planting for continuous yield"
```

### Card 3: Flow Problems → Hydrology

```
TRANSLATION KEY:
- Process → River flow
- Blockages → Dams/sediment
- Energy → Current/grade
- Output → Delta/ocean
- Diversions → Canals/tributaries

SOLUTION PATTERNS:
- "Clear sediment before increasing flow"
- "Follow natural gradient"
- "Oxbow lakes for reflection/processing"
- "Tributaries feed main channel"
```

## Example Workflow

**Problem:** Placement of a cognitive tool within a sovereignty system

```
PROBLEM: Where does analogical thinking belong in the sovereignty system?
DOMAIN: Urban Planning

TRANSLATION:
- Sovereignty system → City
- Kernel → City charter/constitution
- Frameworks → Zoning laws
- Tools → Public services
- Analogical thinking → Public transit system

ANALOGOUS SOLUTION:
Public transit doesn't belong IN the charter, but operates UNDER it.
It's a municipal service enhancing mobility between districts.

REVERSE TRANSLATION:
Analogical thinking is a service governed by the kernel, not part of it.
It enhances cognitive mobility between domains.

KERNEL VERIFICATION: ✅ All 5 principles
IMPLEMENTATION: Create separate "Sovereign Tools" document
```

-----

## Emergency Override

When deeply stuck (72+ hours):

```
Emergency cognitive bypass.
Deploy triple-domain translation:
1. [Domain A] for structure
2. [Domain B] for process
3. [Domain C] for relationships
Synthesize insights.
Kernel verification mandatory.
```

-----

## Domain Expansion Protocol

When a new domain is needed:

1. Study domain principles (3 credible sources)
1. Create translation key (minimum 5 element mappings)
1. Test with a known, solved problem
1. Add to matrix if effective
1. Document with example
